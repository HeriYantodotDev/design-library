Hi everyone and future-me!

Welcome to this repository. So this is a note / reference also as a journal for me to learn about design. 

So Let's get started!

# Meeting The Client
Idea: 
- Solve their problems!
- Make their life easier!

Two Projects: 
- Project A: Follow Along the tutorial: an app to beat Amazon!
- Project B: My own product. I'm still thinking about it. 
  But maybe it's for `restourant stock` dashboard for one of my client or 
  `pogi user` for the other client. Let's decide it later. 

Iteration Step: 

(Note: the iteration step could overflow to each other. This is just a guidelines)
- Planning Phase 
  - How should it look, feel, and do
  - What's the user's goal? How to achieve it using the product
- Design Phase 
  - Turn the idea into a design. 
- Development Phase
  - Turn the design into product 
- Launch Phase
  - We deliver the product to the user
- Post-Launch Phase
  - Hand over the product to the client 

Jobs:
- Designer: Planning, Design & Post-Launch
- Developer: Development, Launch & Post-Launch

Skills for designer: 
- Graphic Design: Colors, Layout, Typography, Imagery. It's the visual!
- User Experience: UX/UI
- Goal Conversion: Drives the result that the client wants!
- Platform Development: Mobile/Web?

We don't have to start from the scratch. We can use online tools. 

# Getting Started
## Sketching
Sketching is a two step process:
- Idea generation: Generate => Sketch
- Adding detain refinement: Add Detail => Refine

From Idea => Wireframes => Components 

The sketching process: 
- Step 1: Be prepared 
  - What are your goals? 
  - Who is your audience? 
  - Time yourself. Just time box yourself
- Step 2: Ready, Set ... Go!
  - Draw a frame for your device: mobile? Web? 
  - Start with a more simple and redundant elements: Header? Footer? 
  - then move onto some more detailed interactions 
  - annotate your sketches and keep them safe. 
  - Keep going: Built an alternative:
  - Share your sketches
- Step 3: Refinement
  - Add titles to your sketches 
  - Add annotations again ... 
  - Use numbers, numbering your sketches. 
  - Use arrows 
  - Add gestures if you want. 

### Sketching User Flows
You can sketch using tablets, an a free application called concepts. 
In this practice, I'm using drawing tables, and `concepts` app in the Windows store.
Or just using Microsoft Whiteboard is fine. 
I'm using Microsoft Whiteboard for this practice, here's the [link](https://wbd.ms/share/v2/aHR0cHM6Ly93aGl0ZWJvYXJkLm1pY3Jvc29mdC5jb20vYXBpL3YxLjAvd2hpdGVib2FyZHMvcmVkZWVtLzA4Y2MyMTIzMzZhOTQzMjk5OTcxYTk5ZmRiYTkyNjhmX0JCQTcxNzYyLTEyRTAtNDJFMS1CMzI0LTVCMTMxRjQyNEUzRF85YWZjNTg4ZC1hYTZjLTQwNDctYTJmYi1kZWQxZTQ3Mzc2YmE=)

- Map the overall flow
  This is my sketch. Lol. So overall, map the overall flow. So just map it the overall flow.

- Specific user flow
  ![Specific flow](./__docImages__/specificUserFlow.png)
- We also need to sketch several alternative for user flow. Whether it's for example how the user access the item / product page, from home page or from search page. So basically the flow. 
- Example: Navigation Scheme
  ![Example1](./__docImages__/navigationScheme1.png)
  ![Example2](./__docImages__/navigationScheme2.png)
- Sketching Screen States

### Tips
- Don't worry to be messy. It's just a sketch, we can refine it late. Be lean, agile. 
- All you need: squares, rectangles, circles. 
- Keep them saved. I'd like to use Microsoft Whiteboard. 
- Please communicate your sketch.
