Hi everyone and future-me!

Welcome to this repository. So this is a note / reference also as a journal for me to learn about design. 

So Let's get started!

# Meeting The Client
Idea: 
- Solve their problems!
- Make their life easier!

Two Projects: 
- Project A: Follow Along the tutorial: an app to beat Amazon!
- Project B: My own product. I'm still thinking about it. 
  But maybe it's for `restourant stock` dashboard for one of my client or 
  `pogi user` for the other client. Let's decide it later. 

Iteration Step: 

(Note: the iteration step could overflow to each other. This is just a guidelines)
- Planning Phase 
  - How should it look, feel, and do
  - What's the user's goal? How to achieve it using the product
- Design Phase 
  - Turn the idea into a design. 
- Development Phase
  - Turn the design into product 
- Launch Phase
  - We deliver the product to the user
- Post-Launch Phase
  - Hand over the product to the client 

Jobs:
- Designer: Planning, Design & Post-Launch
- Developer: Development, Launch & Post-Launch

Skills for designer: 
- Graphic Design: Colors, Layout, Typography, Imagery. It's the visual!
- User Experience: UX/UI
- Goal Conversion: Drives the result that the client wants!
- Platform Development: Mobile/Web?
